# Cyber-Forge: Advanced Password Generator

Cyber-Forge is an advanced password generator designed to help you create strong and secure passwords. This tool incorporates the best practices of password security to ensure the passwords generated are robust and resistant to common attacks.

## Features

- **Common Password Check**: Cyber-Forge checks whether a provided password is commonly known and recommends changing it periodically if it is.
- **Generated Password Suggestions**: You can choose to generate a strong and unique password using the Diceware algorithm implemented in Cyber-Forge.
- **Password Uniqueness**: Cyber-Forge calculates and displays the uniqueness of the generated password based on the number of possible combinations.

## Getting Started

To use Cyber-Forge, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (Python, `random`, `string`, and `humanize`).
3. Run the `cyber_forge.py` script.

## Usage

1. Run the `cyber_forge.py` script.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your current password and choose whether to generate a new password.
3. If you choose to generate a password, Cyber-Forge will display the generated password.
4. After generating a password or validating your current password, Cyber-Forge will calculate and display the uniqueness of the generated password.

## Dependencies

Cyber-Forge relies on the following dependencies:

- Python
- `random` module (built-in)
- `string` module (built-in)
- `humanize` module

Make sure you have these dependencies installed before running the script.
